						<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
						<h3>♦ Payment ♦</h3>
						<p>
							You can either do 50/50 (50% of the payment in the beginning, 
							and 50% after the painting is finished), or the full payment in the beginning.
						</p>
						<p>
							Payments only through paypal in USD only.<br>
							<i>(My refund policies can be found further bellow)</i>
						</p>
						<h4>Please be aware that:</h4>
						<p>
							•­­­ Prices may vary depending on the complexity of the request.<br>
							• Communication is important, so remember to be as clear as possible.<br>
						<br>
							There can be extra charges if I have to deal with constant alterations due to miscommunication.
						</p>
						<h3>♦ Process ♦</h3>
						<p>
							1 -­ After we negotiate a price, I’ll send you the invoice and will start working after confirming the payment.
						</p>
						<hr class="style4">
						<p>
							2 -­ Once the payment is confirmed, 
							I'll need a detail description about the subject, the more information the better!!!
						</p>

							<b>Example:</b>
						<br>
						<p>
							<i>The character is a barbarian, with long dark hair, and long dark beard. He has several scars in his torso, 
							and one scar in his right eye. He also doesn't have the left thumb (lost in battle).  
							The background is a tavern with wooden walls, and wooden shields as decorations hanging on the walls. 
							You can see the window, it is night, and it is raining outside. 
							There is a lot of smoke, with a wild boar being roasted on the grill.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, You can send image references, explaining with part of the image you want me to use in which way.
						</p>
							<b>Example:</b>
						<br>
						<p>
							<i>Here’s an image of a hat that I would like to see something similar in my character.<br> 
							Here’s an image of a motorcycle engine, I would like to incorporate some elements of this design in my character.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<small>Everything that you don't include with specific information, I will use my artistic creativity and fill in the blanks. 
							If you are not sure about what you want to do, we can have a chat too and I can offer some suggestions.</small>
						</p>
						<hr class="style4">
						<p>	
							3 -­  The request will be done step by step and on each step, I’ll send you an update and ask for feedback. 
							After it gets approved, I won't be coming back to change big things in later stages. 
							Updates are made at least once a week.
						</p>
						<hr class="style4">
						<p>
							4 -­  I'll only send the final file after the commission is fully paid.<br>
						</p>
						<hr class="style4">

						<h2>♦ REFUND POLICIES & TERMS OF SERVICE ♦</h2>
						<p><b>On paying my invoices, you're both confirming and agreeing to the following terms, conditions and information:</b></p>
						<hr class="style1">
						<h3><b>(1) Your commission is for personal use only.</b></h3>
						<p>
							You cannot resell any of my work without prior agreement.<br>
							<br>
							If you want my work for commercial/business purposes email me at <b>bielven@gmail.com</b> 
							so we can further discuss the matter.
						</p>
						<hr class="style1">
						<h3>(2) I reserve the right to use any finished commission I make as I see fit.</h3>
						<p>
							​I reserve the right to use any commission I made in order to promote myself and post it on social media, sell, etc, 
							unless we both have explicitly agreed that I can’t do that.
						</p>
						<hr class="style1">
						<h3>(3) 50% of the TOTAL agreed value is non refundable.</h3>
						<p>
							This portion of the payment is used to buy a spot on my work queue, so it won’t ever be refunded. 
							Please be aware that the “50% of the value” refers to the total price we agreed for the piece, 
							so it’s irrelevant the price paid in specific invoices.
						</p>
						<hr class="style1">
						<h3>(4) Your money WON’T be refunded at all if I already started working on your piece and have advanced a few steps on it.</h3>
						<p>
							If you for any the reason decide to cancel the request but I am already working on your request, 
							none of your money will be refunded as you're paying for my invested time and services, and not necessarily for the product itself.
						</p>
						<hr class="style1">
						<h3>(5) You'll credit my work.</h3>
						<p>
							By requesting my services you will agree to credit my work when its being used. 
							The client can use my social media tags for crediting purposes.<br>

						<h3>(7) <b>I DO NOT</b> allow any non-fungible token (NFT) to be made using any of my works.</h3>
